every day i wake up, than i start to break up
Lonely is a man without love
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love

Every day I wake up, then I start to break up
Knowing that it's cloudy above
Every day I start out, then I cry my heart out
Lonely is a man without love


I cannot face this world that's fallen down on me
So if you see my girl, please send her home to me
Tell her about my heart that's slowly dying
Say I can't stop myself from crying
